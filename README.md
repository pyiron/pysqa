High-performance computing (HPC) does not have to be hard. In this context the aim of the Python Simple Queuing System 
Adapter (`pysqa`) is to simplify the submission of tasks from python to HPC clusters as easy as starting another 
`subprocess` locally. This is achieved based on the assumption that even though modern HPC queuing systems offer a wide 
range of different configuration options, most users submit the majority of their jobs with very similar parameters. 

Therefore, in `pysqa` users define submission script templates once and reuse them to submit many different tasks and 
workflows afterwards. These templates are defined in the [jinja2 template language](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/),
so current submission scripts can be easily converted to templates. In addition, to the submission of new tasks to HPC
queuing systems, `pysqa` also allows the users to track the progress of their tasks, delete them or enable reservations 
using the built-in functionality of the queuing system. Finally, `pysqa` enables remote connections to HPC clusters 
using SSH including support for two factor authentication via [pyauthenticator](https://github.com/jan-janssen/pyauthenticator), 
this allows the users to submit task from a python process on their local workstation to remote HPC clusters.

All this functionality is available from both the [Python interface](https://pysqa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example.html) 
as well as the [command line interface](https://pysqa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command.html). 

## Features
The core feature of `pysqa` is the communication to HPC queuing systems including ([Flux](https://pysqa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/queue.html#flux), 
[LFS](https://pysqa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/queue.html#lfs), [MOAB](https://pysqa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/queue.html#moab), 
[SGE](https://pysqa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/queue.html#sge), [SLURM](https://pysqa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/queue.html#slurm) 
and [TORQUE](https://pysqa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/queue.html#torque)). This includes: 

* `QueueAdapter().submit_job()` - Submission of new tasks to the queuing system. 
* `QueueAdapter().get_queue_status()` - List of calculation currently waiting or running on the queuing system. 
* `QueueAdapter().delete_job()` - Deleting calculation which are currently waiting or running on the queuing system. 
* `QueueAdapter().queue_list` - List of available queue templates created by the user.
* `QueueAdapter().config` - Templates to a specific number of cores, run time or other computing resources. With 
  integrated checks if a given submitted task follows these restrictions. 

In addition to these core features, `pysqa` is continuously extended to support more use cases for a larger group of 
users. These new features include the support for remote queuing systems: 

* Remote connection via the secure shell protocol (SSH) to access remote HPC clusters.
* Transfer of files to and from remote HPC clusters, based on a predefined mapping of the remote file system into the 
  local file system. 
* Support for both individual connections as well as continuous connections depending on the network availability. 

Finally, there is current work in progress to support a combination of [multiple local and remote queuing systems](https://pysqa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced.html) 
from within `pysqa`, which are represented to the user as a single resource.
